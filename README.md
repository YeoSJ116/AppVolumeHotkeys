# AppVolumeHotkeys

This is an application to control the volume off an application in your volume mixer.
You just enter some keywords of the windows title you want to control into the textbox.
If the window isn't found try some more words or try to enter a more specific word in there.
Then you can also set the percent of volume per step. This is preset to 10.


If everything is set you can just leave the window opened in the background and control your
volume by pressing PageUp and PageDown for volume up and down. The Hotkeys can't be changed right now
but hopefully will be changeable in the future.
